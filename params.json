It uses an ATMega 168 to PWM 12 LED strips, to render the solar terminator as a non-binary but vertical line.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Completed Projects\r\n\r\n### [Bastille](https://github.com/raidancampbell/Bastille)\r\nResolves CWRU's entire IP block, and parses out the MAC addresses from the default hostnames.  This was an interesting project where I actually began to play with multithreading.  Unfortunately, I later found out that multithreading provided little performance increase, as the DNS server was rate-limiting my queries.\r\n\r\n### TV-B-Gone Rework\r\nA complete rework of [LadyAda's TV-B-Gone](http://www.adafruit.com/product/73), designed to be smaller, brighter, and have a longer battery life.  This was my first foray into low-level electronics, and I learned how to play with Atmel's ATTiny85-series microcontroller.  A three-part writeup can be seen [here](http://electric-satisfaction.blogspot.com/2012/05/tv-b-gone-redesign-part-i-overview.html), [here](http://electric-satisfaction.blogspot.com/2012/05/tv-b-gone-redesign-part-ii-design.html), and [here](http://electric-satisfaction.blogspot.com/2012/05/tv-b-gone-redesign-part-ii-design.html)","google":"UA-62271915-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
